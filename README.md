# Info

In this project we are going to be using the Pandas and Matplotlib libraries to generate varying graphs for data relating to job outcomes of students who graduated from college between 2010 and 2012 in America.

We will be using the original data from American Community Survey, which conducts surveys and aggregates the data. FiveThirtyEight cleaned the dataset and released it on their Github repo. This is the dataset we will be using for this project.

We are going to be exploring questions such as:

- Do students in more popular majors make more money?
- How many majors are predominantly male? Predominantly female?
- Which category of majors have the most students?
- Using a variety of data visualisations.

This project is based on the advice and help of the guided project for Dataquest.
